          UTOPIA is more than just a concept—it’s a movement toward a decentralized, inclusive, and empowered future.
          In a world where centralized systems dominate finance, communication, and governance, UTOPIA introduces a radical alternative:
          a digital ecosystem where individuals, not institutions, are in control.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its core, UTOPIA harnesses the power of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to offer freedom, privacy, and equal access.
          It breaks down traditional barriers and allows anyone, anywhere, to participate in a truly global network.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the key things UTOPIA can do is democratize finance. Through decentralized finance (DeFi), users can lend, borrow,
          trade, and earn interest without going through banks or middlemen.
        </p>
        <p>
          But UTOPIA goes beyond finance. It creates spaces for decentralized collaboration where communities can organize, vote,
          and manage resources transparently. Privacy is another cornerstone—UTOPIA empowers users to control their personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creators and innovators thrive in UTOPIA. Artists, developers, and entrepreneurs can tokenize their work, raise funds through NFTs,
          and connect directly with global supporters. Ultimately, UTOPIA is about freedom—economic, digital, and creative.
        </p>
        <p>
          The future doesn’t have to be centralized. With UTOPIA, a new world is not only possible—it’s already being built.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Info Section */}
      <div id="info" style={sectionStyle}>
        <h1>Info</h1>
        <p>
          UTOPIA isn’t just a new way to handle money or data—it’s a new way to work, together. It creates a decentralized environment
          that promotes transparency, trust, and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          With blockchain, teams coordinate projects, manage tasks, and handle payments without middlemen. Smart contracts automate
          everything—define goals, distribute roles, and release payments when tasks are done.
        </p>
        <p>
          UTOPIA is borderless. Team members from Tokyo to Lagos can collaborate and get paid instantly in crypto. DAOs allow voting and
          decision-making transparently. Workers aren’t just employees—they're co-owners, earning equity and shaping the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          By removing delays and bureaucracy, UTOPIA lets people focus on building. Trust becomes the default, not the exception.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Read Section */}
      <div id="read" style={sectionStyle}>
        <h1>Read</h1>
        <p>
          UTOPIA is a flexible system transforming how industries operate—art, tech, education, finance, and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Creative Industries:</strong> Smart contracts ensure fair pay. NFTs allow artists to track royalties and get paid directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Software & Tech:</strong> Dev teams manage tasks and bugs on-chain, with instant crypto payouts and global collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Freelancers:</strong> No invoices, just smart milestones and fair pay. Build a global rep on-chain.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4. Education:</strong> Courses and certificates live on-chain. Teachers and students connect peer-to-peer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>5. Finance:</strong> UTOPIA automates payroll, budgeting, and spending using DeFi. DAOs manage funds and vote transparently.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>6. Nonprofits:</strong> Receive donations directly and transparently. Show your impact in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          UTOPIA adapts to any workflow. Less friction. More flow. Let’s build the future—decentralized.
